# Use of GAN Smart Cubes in Godot!

This is a reimplementation of [gan-web-bluetooth](https://github.com/afedotov/gan-web-bluetooth) by afedotov in gdscript. So you can make games that use cubes as a control device!

Depends on this wonderful Godot plugin that lets you use Bluetooth in Godot: https://github.com/Fantety/GDBLE

Currently the repo just contains a sample scene with a cube visualizer. Tested with a Gen 4 GAN cube. Not tested yet with Gen 2/3.
